### Improve user experience with one login

### Enable zero-trust security

### Simplify identity governance in cloud-first environments
###  Installation & Setup:
### Okta is cloud-based; you don’t install it locally. Instead, you create and manage from their portal.
## Steps:
### Go to https://developer.okta.com/signup/

### Create a free developer account.

### Log in to the Okta Admin Console.
